## About The Project

With this project we tried to achive what other didn't and that is a soundboard that can be used on your phone and on a computer at the same time. 

## Built With

The Windows variant was built with python and the mobile one with Flutter

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

To use this we recommend installing https://vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm
In the future we hope to create our own virtual cable driver.

## Extra settings for the virtual cable
- Right click the volume icon in the right down corner
- Click on "Open sound Setting"
- On the right side click on "Sound Control Panel"
- Go to "Recording Tab"
- Right click on your current microphone and click on "Properties"
- Go to "Listen" tab then click on "Payback through this device" and select "CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)"
- Check the "Listen to this device" box and Apply
!! THIS IS NOT NECESSARY BUT IT IS RECOMMENDED

### Installation

To edit and run the code on your machine first you need to open the terminal in the current directory and run this command
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
after that use
```sh
python mainSound.py
```

## Usage

This app is used to simulate sound through a virtual microphone. Those sounds can be activated by using a hotkey on your computer or by pressing a button on your phone.
